          <p>I was first introduced to Ruby and Rails back in 2006 with the Pragmatic Programmer's book
          <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails2/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails (2nd edition)</a>.</p>
          <p>I used it for hobby programming off and on until 2010, when I had the
          opportunity to switch from Django and PHP to using Rails professionally.
          Coming from the world of Django and its settings.py, the phrase
          "convention over configuration" was especially refreshing.</p>
          <p>One thing about Rails that I've become particularly enamored with is
          the community. From Ryan Bates' RailsCasts to the Ruby Rogues to expansive
          Ruby/Rails community on github, I feel like I always have someone to turn
          to who genuinely wants to help.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a> <small>ruby gem manager</small></h2>
          <p>When I switched from to ruby from python fulltime I immediately started
          searching for a replacement to virtualenv. Thank goodness I quickly found
          rvm; it was exactly what I was hoping for. Rvm turned out to be an even
          more capable tool since it managed language versions in addition to
          project libraries.</p>

           <p>I use the git command line interface for everything except staging
           commits; that's where GitX comes in. GitX allows me to easily see the
           differences that I'm about to commit, stage files or sections of a file,
           and amend the previous commit.</p>

          a <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2006/ruby-screencast-unit-testing/">Unit Testing screencast by James Edward Grey</a> back in
          September 2006. I was immediately hooked.</p>
          <p>I dove through Grey's pragmatic programmer's book on TextMate and made
          myself an expert. I can slice through text files, HTML, JQuery, and ruby
          like butter. Even years later it's still the editor that looks gorgeous
          and gets out of my way.</p>

          I had just finished spending four hours trying to get a Rails app to

           <p>When my Rails apps need to do some background processing, I turn to
           resque to keep my user experience snappy. Good examples are sending
           emails, calling out to slow third party APIs, or doing intensive
           processing.</p>
           <p>Recently <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/qu">Qu</a> has been released. It makes a
           <a href="http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2011/10/19/why-another-queuing-library/">persuasive argument</a>

          <p>The Rails 3.1 asset pipeline is the answer to a problem I didn't quite
          realize I had: sanely partitioning third-party libraries, images, and
          styling from those specific to my applications.</p>
          <p>I can now drop resources like the
          <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap css</a> I'm using on this site into
          /vendor then pull them into my application by adding them to the

          no small feat since ContentDM is a complex third party application of
