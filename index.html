          <p>I was first introduced to Ruby and Rails back in 2006 with the Pragmatic Programmer's book
          <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails2/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails (2nd edition)</a>.</p>
          <p>I used it for hobby programming off and on until 2010, when I had the
          opportunity to switch from Django and PHP to using Rails professionally.
          Coming from the world of Django and its settings.py, the phrase
          "convention over configuration" was especially refreshing.</p>
          <p>One thing about Rails that I've become particularly enamored with is
          the community. From Ryan Bates' RailsCasts to the Ruby Rogues to expansive
          Ruby/Rails community on github, I feel like I always have someone to turn
          to who genuinely wants to help.</p>

          <p>I've been using ruby for scripts since I got into the language
          around 2005. Coming from perl, I was pleased to find that a lot of the
          idioms I was familiar with still worked.</p>
          <p>My favorite things about Ruby? It's beautiful, expressive, and the community is fantastic.</p>

          Crockford, The JavaScript Programming Language</a> and it
          single-handedly opened my eyes to the power, functionality, and (yes)
          beauty of JavaScript.</p>
          <p>The introduction of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> at

          web applications without an ORM, so I'm quite comfortable getting down
          into the database level and pulling together some SQL.</p>

          rvm; it was exactly what I was hoping for. Rvm turned out to be an even

          September 2006. I was immediately hooked.</p>
          <p>I dove through Grey's pragmatic programmer's book on TextMate and made
          myself an expert. I can slice through text files, HTML, JQuery, and ruby
          like butter. Even years later it's still the editor that looks gorgeous

            <p>I follow dozens of news feeds and programming blogs to keep current.</p>
            <p>Some highlights</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Chris's
              Wiki</a>: the blog of a sysadmin and python programming. A lot of
              what he goes into is both above my head and lower level than I
              normally get, but I still enjoy reading it.</li>
              <li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>: a
              great place to keep up with the tech and business</li>
              <li><a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a>: I was following
              this site back in the 90s and have the low five digit uid to show
              for it. I actually remember when /. introduced user accounts but
              waited to sign up for one because I thought that registering onto
              a website was a weird idea.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">rubyflow</a>: the ruby
              community blog, full of great links and posts</li>

            <h2><a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a></h2>
            <p>I'm addicted to these books. I bought an iPad in large part
            because of its capabilities as an epub reader so I could have my
            pragprog collection (34 books and counting!) wherever I go.</p>
            <p>In addition to books, their <a
            href="http://pragprog.com/magazines">monthly magazine</a> is a
            wonderful resource.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://rubyrogues.com/">Ruby Rogues</a></h2>
            <p>This is a relatively new podcast &mdash; started in May 2011
            &mdash; but it's proven to be a superb resource. Every week we get
            to hear a round table discussion of actual programming techniques
            and concepts from some of the top names in Ruby.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a></h2>
            <p>I can't fully describe how invaluable this website has been to
            me. For learning a new tool or technique, nothing beats following
            along with Bates' informative and insightful screencasts. Every new
            video seems to hit something that I was just talking about looking
            into with a co-worker.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span5">
            <h2><a href="http://github.com">github</a></h2>
            <p>Sure, github is great for hosting git repos. But it's biggest
            benefit is the social coding community that it's managed to build. I
            learn a lot by browsing through code the projects that I use; github
            makes it so easy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span5">
            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>To learn how to develop software nothing beats actually creating
            software. I firmly believe that there is an amount of mental muscle
            memory that goes along with being a great programmer.</p>
            <p>Reading about a good technique? Ok if you're just about to use
            it. Reading about a good technique, writing a script around it,
            breaking it and seeing how it all fits together? Now you've built up
            some context memory around that technique and will be more ready to
            recognize when it can and should be applied.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite hobby programming assignments is to improve
            DuckDuckGo. Yegg has built a system for enhancement that is
            surprisingly approachable and well suited for hacking on simple and
            fun features.</p>
